  - There have sure been some interesting realities that big slimy fish has torn
    into.
  - My favorite was one that was all black and white.
  - There was this gumshoe, a real hard hitter, who stuck around for a while.
  - "I felt like I\u2019d found a long lost brother! We liked all the same stuff,
    it was like we came from the same stinkin\u2019 city."
  - "But eventually he said somethin\u2019 about his conscience and ran off to the
    dock.\r"
  - "\u2018Eatin\u2019 him like the rot that was eatin\u2019 his city\u2019s underbelly,\u2019

  - He always talked all dramatic-like.
