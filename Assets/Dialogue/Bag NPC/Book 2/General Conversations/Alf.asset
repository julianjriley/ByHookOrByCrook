  - Oh, Alf over there? Yeah, a real barrel of monkeys.
  - "He\u2019s not what you\u2019d call, eh, conscious of his injury. Doesn\u2019t
    seem to know he\u2019s got a hook in his skull.\r"
  - "Reminds me of an uncle I had with a hole in his stomach.\r"
  - "If you could bottle nonsense, the last thing I\u2019d be makin\u2019 is no cents,
