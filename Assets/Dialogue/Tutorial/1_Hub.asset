  - Looks like we've got another one! On your feet - press E to make this conversation
    go a little faster.
  - You're either one hell of an angler, or one of the most unfortunate fishermen
    I've ever seen.
  - The name's Skipper. Don't go wearing it out.
  - You'll meet a lot of new people here - welcome to the ROCK BEYOND REALITY! It's
    your one-stop shop for fishing, guns, fish that are guns, and tentacle tantrums.
  - This place and its heroes are the last thing standing between the Cosmoctopus
    - the thing that pulled you down here - and the total destruction of every reality.
  - You can take a minute, if you want. That one usually throws people off.
  - It's usually a bit livelier around here, but it seems all the shopkeeps are hiding.
    Don't take it too personally - they're probably just waiting to see if you survive.
  - I can see in your eyes that you've got questions - but there's no time for them
    now.
  - Destiny and the Great Rift have cast you outside of reality to be our next hero!
    Don't ask about the previous ones.
  - If we wanna keep you from meeting their fate, you'll have to prepare for battle,
    and to prepare for battle, you'll have to go fishing.
  - Don't worry your cute fuzzy little head. I won't toss you into the deep end and
    watch you flounder - I ain't no sadist. I'll help wherever I can!
  - Now, why don't you head on over to the dock, and we'll see about wrangling you
    up something useful.
