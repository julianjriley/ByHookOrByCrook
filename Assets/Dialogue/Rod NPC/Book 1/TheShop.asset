  - This shop used to belong to my grandfather.
  - He lived a quiet life on this floating rock until one day, he got it into his
    head to try and be a hero.
  - Said he was tired of watching countless heroes lose their lives to those tentacles
    and not being able to do anything about it.
  - So what did he do? Hmph. The old fool dove headfirst into the rift and never
    came back.
  - "Huh? Why are you sorry for my loss? Oh, you misunderstood. The old fool dove
    into the wrong rift. He\u2019s not dead. Just\u2026 falling. For eternity."
  - If you head over to the docks you may be able to see him.
