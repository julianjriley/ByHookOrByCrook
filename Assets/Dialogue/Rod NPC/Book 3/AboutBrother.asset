  - Do you remember the hero I mentioned before? The one who single handedly took
    out three tentacles?
  - "Well\u2026"
  - He was my brother.
  - "I know, real shocking isn\u2019t it?"
  - '*sigh* He was everything a hero should be. Strong. Brave. Selfless.'
  - "But in the end, it wasn\u2019t enough."
  - He was felled in the Candy Dimension by Terrorgummy Tentacle.
  - That loss was what sparked my grandfather to try and take vengeance.
  - But all the old fool accomplished was leaving me here. Alone.
  - "Anyway, I\u2019m not telling you all this for sympathy."
  - "I just thought\u2026 you deserved to know. Since you inherited my brother\u2019s
    fight, albeit, against your will."
