  - "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the wanted posters for those tentacles scattered
    about."
  - There used to be eight terrors, as expected of an octopus, but the heroes that
    came before you managed to whittle down that number to three.
  - "One of the heroes was\u2026"
  - "He\u2026"
  - '*sigh* He managed  to slay two tentacles all by himself. Everyone here thought
    he was gonna be the one to finally put an end to this nightmare. Including me.'
  - But I quickly learned that those thoughts were just fueled by hope. And hope
    is an illusion.
  - It means nothing.
